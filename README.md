## Overview
Survey of women in Brazil in 1986 and 1996 regarding health and health practices that include nutrition, contraception, cleanliness of drinking water, media consumption, literacy, child mortality, and many other factors. These data were gathered by separating Brazil into 6 locations (São Paulo, Rio De Janeiro, Southern, Central (West and East in 1996), Northeastern, and Northern) and distributing a paper survey to women from various locations across each region. The goal of this study will be to compare health behaviors between these data and note any improvements.
